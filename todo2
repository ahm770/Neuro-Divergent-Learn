Full LTI 1.3 / LTI Advantage Compliance (as a Tool Provider)

...into your existing project would effectively transform it from a specialized content delivery portal into a full-fledged Learning Management System (LMS) with a strong accessibility focus.

published: Boolean (default: false)

estimatedCompletionTimeMinutes: Number (optional)

createdAt, updatedAt

B. Core Backend Controllers & Routes (Backend)

State Management for Quiz Taking: Handling student answers, timers, and submissions robustly.





III. LTI 1.3 / LTI Advantage Compliance (Tool Provider)

A. Database Model Considerations (Backend)

You'll need to store LTI registration details provided by Tool Consumers (LMSs).

LtiPlatformRegistration.js:

platformName: String (e.g., "University X Canvas")

issuer: String (LMS's OIDC issuer URL - unique identifier)

clientId: String (Your client ID for this LMS)

deploymentId: String (Specific to a placement of your tool in the LMS)

authLoginUrl: String (LMS's OIDC auth endpoint)

authTokenUrl: String (LMS's token endpoint)

jwksUrl: String (LMS's public key set URL for verifying tokens)

deepLinkingApiUrl: String (If supporting Deep Linking service)

namesAndRolesApiUrl: String (If supporting NRPS)

assignmentAndGradeApiUrl: String (If supporting AGS)

Potentially map LTI user IDs and course IDs to your internal system IDs if you need to de-duplicate or link existing accounts/content.

LtiUserLink.js: ltiUserId, ltiContextId (course), internalUserId

LtiCourseLink.js: ltiContextId, internalCourseId

B. Core Backend Controllers & Routes

ltiController.js & ltiRoutes.js:

/lti/login (OIDC Initiation): Endpoint specified in your tool configuration in the LMS. Redirects to LMS's auth URL.

/lti/launch (OIDC Redirect/Launch): The redirect URI after LMS authentication. Handles ID token validation, LTI message validation, user provisioning/linking, and then redirects the user to the appropriate content/page in your tool. This is the main LTI entry point.

/lti/jwks (Your Public Keys): Endpoint for LMSs to fetch your public keys if you are signing anything back to them (less common for basic launch).

/lti/deeplink (If supporting Deep Linking): Handles requests from LMS when an instructor wants to embed your content.

Endpoints for AGS (if you send grades back): e.g., /lti/courses/:contextId/lineitems, /lti/courses/:contextId/lineitems/:lineitemId/scores.

Endpoints for NRPS (if you fetch rosters): e.g., /lti/courses/:contextId/roster.

C. Main Frontend Components/Pages

Less direct UI for LTI itself from the student's perspective. The goal is seamless integration.

Admin UI for LTI Platform Registration: A form for admins to input the details of an LMS that wants to connect to your tool.

Instructor UI for Deep Linking: If an instructor launches your tool in "Deep Linking" mode from their LMS, your portal needs to show them a browseable/searchable view of your content (courses, modules, topics) so they can select items to send back to the LMS.

D. Key Challenges:

OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect (OIDC): Deep understanding of these security protocols is essential.

LTI Specifications: The specs are detailed and can be complex. LTI 1.3 is more secure but also more involved than older versions.

Security: Validating JWTs (ID tokens, access tokens), handling state parameters, preventing replay attacks.

Libraries: Using robust, well-maintained LTI libraries for Node.js (e.g., ltijs by cvmcosta on npm) is highly recommended. Do NOT try to implement all of LTI from scratch.

Testing: Requires setting up a test LMS environment (e.g., a free Canvas account, Moodle instance, or using an LTI reference implementation).

Error Handling: Gracefully handling LTI launch errors and providing useful messages.

Service Interactions (AGS, NRPS): Making authenticated API calls back to the LMS.

General Advice for This Scale of Development:

Break It Down Further: Each of these three areas is a project in itself. Start with the smallest valuable increment. For example:

Course Hierarchy: Basic Course > Module > Lesson structure (linking to existing Content topics).

Assessments: Implement one simple quiz type (e.g., MCQ) with auto-grading.

LTI: Basic LTI launch to view a specific Content topic (no grade pass-back yet).

Team or Significant Time: This is not a solo weekend project. It requires substantial, dedicated development time.

Prioritize Based on Your Core Vision: Your original vision is an "Accessible Learning Portal for Neurodivergent Students."

Enhancements to accessibility and personalization (like more granular simplification, sensory controls, AI tutor improvements) might be more aligned with your unique value proposition than, say, full LTI compliance initially.

However, if institutional adoption is key, LTI becomes more important.

UX/UI Design: Each new feature, especially authoring tools for courses and assessments, will require careful UX/UI design to be usable and accessible.

Iterate and Get Feedback: Build a small piece, test it (ideally with target users), get feedback, and then build the next piece.

This is a massive but exciting expansion. I recommend picking one sub-feature from one of these areas to start with and focusing on implementing that thoroughly. Good luck!
