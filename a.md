ðŸŽ¯ Project Concept: Accessible Learning Portal for Neurodivergent Students
ðŸš© Problem
Traditional online learning platforms are often one-size-fits-all, which can overwhelm or exclude students with:

ADHD

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD)

Dyslexia or other learning differences

These students may struggle with:

Long, text-heavy content

Lack of interactive or visual learning

Poorly structured or overwhelming interfaces

ðŸ’¡ Solution
A customizable learning platform that adapts content format, layout, and interaction style based on a studentâ€™s neurotype or preferences.

âœ¨ Key Features
Content Mode Switching

Let students choose how they want to consume content:

ðŸ“„ Text summary (simplified, dyslexia-friendly font)

ðŸŽ¥ Video explainer (auto-generated or sourced)

ðŸ§­ Visual map (concept maps)

ðŸ”Š Audio narration

Personalized Learning Path

Uses AI to assess how a student learns best and suggests the best format and sequence.

Distraction-Free Mode

Clean, minimal UI with adjustable font size, color schemes, and focus modes.

Interactive Companion

An LLM-powered chatbot  to explain, quiz, and guide students through topics based on their style.

Progress Feedback

Visual indicators of understanding and time spent to build confidence instead of pressure.

ðŸ§  Tech Stack (example)
Frontend: React  

Backend: Node.js/Express  

AI:
OpenRouter API	Interface for GPT-style AI models (Zephyr, Mistral, Mixtral)
Simplification, generation, and reasoning

LangChain for multi-modal response formatting

Database: MongoDB  

Optional: Use TensorFlow Lite or Edge AI models for local inference

ðŸ“£ Social Good Impact
Promotes equity in education by recognizing that neurodivergent students need different ways to thrive.
